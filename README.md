# UserLocation
A single view app to show user's current location

This is simple single view app to show the live location of the user. We've used Mapkit library to demonastrate this task.
Simply open the app in xcode and run the application in the virtual device.

In that case you've to give every location co-ordinate to the virtual device manually. For physical device it doesn't necessary.
